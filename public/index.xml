      <description>But Why? I&amp;rsquo;m a developer, I made this website for 2 reasons!
1 - BEING FRIENDLY I share demos hosted on this website. Recruiters, partners, developers come here to see them and possibly check the root page. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to display an error page so I put an amazing meme instead:
Previous version of thommil.com Feedbacks were not as good as expected.
2 - BEING CREDIBLE 1998, I created a copycat of Facebook which was developed in &amp;hellip; 2004, 2001, I developed my own AJAX framework, AJAX was introduced in &amp;hellip; 2005, 2006, I published a successful serverless commercial solution, 2008, I&amp;rsquo;ve offered the recipe of Pineapple Kebab to the world (forget this one).</description>

      <description>TL;DR My love affair with the game engines. The story of all the gamers who have become developers, from fantasy to disillusion.
Full story One upon a time&amp;hellip; My childhood was marked by several of the big names of video games:
Wolfenstein 3D - John Carmack - 1992 Ultima 7 - Richard Garriott - 1992 Another World - Eric Chahi - 1991 If you want to know a little more about their work, go to Fabien Sanglard&amp;rsquo;s website.</description>
