## But Why?
I'm a developer, I made this website for 2 reasons!

## 1 - BEING FRIENDLY
I share demos hosted on this website. Recruiters, partners, developers come here to see them and possibly check the root page. I didn't want to display an error page so I put an amazing meme instead:

<div class="big-img">
    <img src="/images/meme.jpg" alt="Crappy meme"/>
    <figcaption>Previous version of thommil.com</figcaption>
</div>

Feedbacks were not as good as expected.

## 2 - BEING CREDIBLE
 * **1998**, I created a copycat of Facebook which was developed in ... **2004**,
 * **2001**, I developed my own AJAX framework, AJAX was introduced in ... **2005**,
 * **2006**, I published a successful serverless commercial solution,
 * **2008**, I've offered the recipe of Pineapple Kebab to the world (forget this one).

Do you believe me? Do you think these achievements were valuable? We don't care as I can't show you.

All I can do about it now, it's a new amazing meme:

<div class="big-img">
    <img src="/images/facebook.jpg" alt="TL;DR"/>
    <figcaption>TL;DR</figcaption>
</div>

That's why I dug in my repositories, rebuilt several of my old projects and made videos, to keep a trace, here.

So, if I can give you an advice, here it is, old fashion style:
<div class="blink"><div>MAKE VIDEOS OF YOUR ACHIEVEMENTS</div></div>

Thanks for reading!

### Bonus content
This website was created with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), an excellent site generator which I strongly recommend if you don't want to waste your time or publish crappy memes.
