## But Why?
I'm a developer, I made this website for 2 reasons!

## The first reason: "BEING SERIOUS"
I've created projects hosted on my cloud and I was using subdomains to hosts them. Sometimes, I shared my job on social networks, with my peers or simply some lost souls came to my homepage:

<div class="big-img">
    <img src="/images/meme.jpg" alt="Crappy meme"/>
    <figcaption>Previous version of thommil.com</figcaption>
</div>

I was very proud of this meme but feedbacks were not as good as expected.

## The second reason: "STOPING LOOSING MY WORK"
Last year, I went to a restaurant where a friend of mine works as a chief. At the end of the meal, his boss came to our table and said :
> Your the guy who created Facebook before than Facebook was a thing, Bob (obviously not his real name) always talks about that?

I was embarrassed, I answered that I never done such a thing, just a cooperative website in 1998 with following features:
 * Shared walls and moods
 * Profiles
 * Private messages
 * Online games
 * Heavy use of emojis (called smileys then)

Wait! No that was not Facebook, that was not unique and even if I was proud of the technical part, it was just dead simple.

In 2001, I made a prototype of a smart client using dynamic HTML and asynchronous requests (using frames). Yes, AJAX!

In 2006, I published a framework for hosting APIs without code based on OSGi. Yes, servless platform!

Do you believe me? In any case, I can't prove it, the only think I can do now with these projects is a crappy meme:

<div class="big-img">
    <img src="/images/facebook.jpg" alt="TL;DR"/>
    <figcaption>TL;DR</figcaption>
</div>

That's why I dug in my repositories, rebuilt several of my old projects and made videos, to keep a trace, here.

So if I have an advice, here it is, old fashion style:
<div class="blink">MAKE VIDEOS OF YOUR ACHIEVEMENTS</div>

Thanks for reading!
