## But Why?
I'm a developer, I made this website for 2 reasons!

## The first reason: "BEING SERIOUS"
I've created projects hosted on my cloud and I was using subdomains to hosts them. Sometimes, I shared my job on social networks, with my peers or simply some lost souls came to my homepage:

<div class="big-img">
    <img src="/images/meme.jpg" alt="Crappy meme"/>
    <figcaption>Previous version of thommil.com</figcaption>
</div>

I was very proud of this meme but feedbacks were not as good as expected.

## The second reason: "STOP LOOSING MY WORK"

<div class="big-img">
    <img src="/images/facebook.jpg" alt="TL;DR"/>
    <figcaption>TL;DR</figcaption>
</div>

Thanks for reading!

### Bonus content
This website was created with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), an excellent site generator which I strongly recommend if you don't want to waste your time or publish crappy memes.
